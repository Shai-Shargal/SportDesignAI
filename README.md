# SportDesignAI

SportDesignAI is an AI-powered platform for designing custom sportswear sets (shirt and pants) with interactive 3D visualization. The platform generates unique designs using artificial intelligence, which users can customize further. Final designs are exported as 2D templates suitable for manufacturing.

## Features
- **AI-Generated Designs**: Automatically create unique and engaging sportswear designs using AI.
- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Rotate and view the sportswear set (shirt and pants) from all angles.
- **Custom Design Tools**: Users can modify AI-generated designs, select colors, patterns, and add logos.
- **2D Template Export**: Convert 3D designs into 2D templates ready for manufacturing.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design process.

## Why SportDesignAI?
The platform addresses the lack of creativity in sportswear designs available in the market by leveraging AI to produce innovative patterns and styles. It eliminates the need for a graphic designer, streamlining the design process and making it accessible to everyone.

## Tech Stack
- **AI Model**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for generating designs.
- **Frontend**: React.js, Three.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (for saving designs and user preferences)
- **Export Logic**: Fabric.js or custom algorithms for generating 2D templates.
- **Hosting**: Vercel for frontend, AWS for backend.

## How It Works
1. **AI Design Generation**: AI generates a unique sportswear set design (shirt and pants) based on predefined rules or user inputs.
2. **User Customization**: Users can fine-tune the design by adjusting colors, patterns, and logo placement.
3. **3D Preview**: View the design in 3D with rotation and zoom capabilities.
4. **Export to 2D Template**: Generate a 2D vector file (e.g., SVG or PDF) of the design.
5. **Send to Manufacturer**: Provide the 2D template file to a factory for production.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shai-Shargal/SportDesignAI
